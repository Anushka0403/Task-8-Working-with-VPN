Cyber Security Internship/ Task-8: Working with VPN

## What is a VPN?
 A **Virtual Private Network (VPN)** creates a secure, encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet. It helps protect your data from hackers, surveillance, and tracking.

## How Does a VPN Protect Your Privacy?

 * **Encrypts your internet traffic** so that third parties can't read your data.
 * **Hides your IP address**, masking your identity and location.
 * Prevents websites, trackers, and ISPs from monitoring your activity.


## VPN vs Proxy

* VPN encrypts data + IP masking
* Proxy only hides IP (no encryption)
